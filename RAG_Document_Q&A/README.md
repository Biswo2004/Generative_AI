# üìö Research Paper Q&A Chatbot


A **Streamlit-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot** that allows users to upload research papers (PDF) and ask questions based on their content. Powered by **Groq LLM** and **OpenAI embeddings**, it supports **English** and **Hindi**, voice input, and text-to-speech (TTS) responses.

## üåü Features

- Upload multiple **PDF research papers** for analysis.
- Ask questions and get answers based on **document content**.
- **Voice input** support for hands-free queries.
- **Text-to-speech** output for answers.
- **Semantic search** using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS vector store.
- **Groq LLM** integration for fast, accurate responses.
- Maintain **chat history** with timestamps and ability to clear it.
- **Document similarity view** to check referenced content.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This project uses **OpenAI embeddings**, so an **OpenAI API key is mandatory**.
- OpenAI usage may incur a **minimum cost of $5 USD**, which typically amounts to **‚Çπ500‚Äì‚Çπ550 INR** after forex charges.If you are comfortable to pay that much amount then head to (https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) and signup
- üí° If you prefer a free alternative, you can switch to Ollama or Hugging Face embedding models. These options work well for local or open-source setups and can be integrated with FAISS or other vector stores.
- Ensure your **microphone** is working for voice input.
- Only **PDF files** are supported.
- Groq API key must be valid and start with `gsk_`.
- Embedding creation may take a few seconds depending on PDF size.
- Voice input uses Google Speech Recognition ‚Äî internet connection required.
- TTS playback uses `gTTS` and may vary slightly in pronunciation.
- App styling includes custom gradients and hover effects for better UX.

3. Select your **language** (English or Hindi).

4. Upload one or more **PDF research papers**.

5. Enter your **query** (or use voice input).

6. Click **Search** to generate an answer.
   * The response will appear in a styled card.
   * TTS playback will automatically play the answer.

7. Explore **document similarity** for context reference.

8. Check **chat history** in the sidebar and clear history if needed.
